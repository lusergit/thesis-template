\section{Recursion theory}\label{sec:two}

% Section example with some environments such as `definition`,
% `notation`, `lemma` and `proof`

This first section aims to provide background and terminology for the
parts in recursion theory that will follow. More in detail, we'll take
some notation from~\cite{cutland1980computability} and introduce some
new notation based on the same book.

We start with functions: total and partial functions are essential to
recursion theory:

\begin{definition}[Total and partial functions]
  Let \(X,Y\) be two sets. We denote by \[X \to Y\] the set of all
  total functions from \(X\) to \(Y\).  And by
  \[X \hto Y\] the set of all partial functions from \(X\) to
  \(Y\).
\end{definition}
\noindent

Partial functions are actually functions from a subset
\(S \subseteq X\) which is called the \emph{natural domain} of \(f\)

\begin{definition}[Domain of partial functions]
  Let \(f : X \hto Y\). We write \(f(x)\downarrow\) to indicate that
  \(f\) is defined on \(x\), and \(f(x)\uparrow\) to indicate that
  \(f\) is undefined on \(x\). Hence
  \[dom(f) = \{x \in X \mid f(x)\downarrow\}\]
\end{definition}

We then need, mostly in Section~\ref{sec:functionsimp} to talk about
partial recursive functions and their properties. We therefore define
partial recursive and total recursive functions as follows:

\begin{notation}[partial and total recursive
  functions]\label{bg:partialrec}
  By \(\partialrec[k]\) we denote the set of partial recursive
  functions on natural numbers, while by \(\n \tor \n\) we denote the
  set of partial recursive functions on natural numbers.
\end{notation}

We also need to talk about decidable properties and decidable sets. We
therefore introduce the notion of recursive and recursively enumerable
sets.

\begin{definition}[Recursively enumerable and recursive sets]
  A set \(A \subseteq \n^k\) is \emph{recursively enumerable} (r.e.\
  or semi-decidable) if \(A = dom(f)\) for some
  \(f \in \partialrec[k]\).
  
  A set \(A\subseteq \n\) is a recursive set if both \(A\) and its
  complement \(\overline{A} = \n \setminus A\) are semi-decidable,
  i.e., there exists some \(f \in \n \tor \n\) s.t.
  \[f = \lambda n . (n \in A) ? 1 : 0\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Computable function over a recursive set]\label{le:comprec}
  Given \(f : A \tor B\), let the domain \(A\) to be recursive. \(B\)
  is at least r.e.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \(f : A \tor B\) total recursive function over a recursive set
  \(A\). We can write the function
  \[\bigx_B = \lambda x . sg(\mu z . |f(z) - x|)\] which is computable
  as it is composition of computable functions. In other terms, this
  function
  \begin{equation*}
    \bigx_B(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & x \in B \\
      \uparrow & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  is the semi-decision function for \(B\)
\end{proof}

\begin{observation}\label{obs:comprec}
  In general, \(B\) is not recursive, as it would means that both
  \(A \leq_m B\) and \(B \leq_m A\), which is not always the case, but
  it is r.e., as we could always write the inverse function as in
  Lemma~\ref{le:comprec} and derive a semi-decision function for the
  image of the function.
\end{observation}
