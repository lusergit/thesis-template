* Compilation
  =pwd= should be the root folder of the project.
  #+begin_src sh
    make -k
  #+end_src
** Requirements
   The project in order to compile requires a =latex-full=-like
   environment with =latexmk= and =make= installed
** Results
   Results are available at [[./out/thesis.pdf]]
** Spellcheck
   with =aspell= installed you can run a spellcheck of the whole
   thesis source /file by file/ by running =./spellcheck.sh= on
   linux/mac.
** Old files, discarded files
   You can void git tracking some files by placing them in subfolders
   of the =src/= folder either named =old= or =discarded=, take a look
   at [[./.gitignore]] for more info.
** Emacs
   =utils.el= contains utility functions to integrate the latex
   development of the project with emacs.
